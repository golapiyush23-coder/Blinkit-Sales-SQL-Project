# Blinkit-Sales-SQL-Project
In this project, I analyzed the Blinkit sales dataset in detail to improve sales, marketing, and customer satisfaction. I found out which products sold the most, which categories had the highest sales, sales distribution across outlets and locations, measure the effect of fat content, outlet size, and establishment year on sales, region trends, etc.
